This bug occurs when using the Expo Camera API with custom camera configurations.  The issue manifests as the camera preview failing to render correctly, appearing as a black screen or displaying a distorted image. This problem is particularly noticeable when using specific camera settings or on certain devices. It appears to be related to inconsistencies in how Expo handles custom camera parameters. The exact cause is difficult to pinpoint without further investigation but may be linked to device-specific hardware limitations or incompatibility between custom settings and the underlying camera implementation within Expo.
