# Expo Camera Preview Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug in Expo's Camera API where the preview fails to render correctly when using custom camera configurations. The preview may appear as a black screen or display a distorted image. This issue seems to be related to inconsistencies in how Expo handles specific camera parameters on different devices.

## Bug Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `expo start` to start the Expo development server.
4. Observe the camera preview.  You may need to test on different devices or with various camera setting combinations to trigger the bug.

## Solution

The provided solution attempts to resolve the rendering issue by adding more robust error handling and fallback mechanisms. It also involves carefully reviewing and adjusting the custom camera configurations to ensure compatibility across different devices and Expo versions.
